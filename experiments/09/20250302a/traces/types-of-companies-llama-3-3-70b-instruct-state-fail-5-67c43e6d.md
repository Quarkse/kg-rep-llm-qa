Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `Think:` section followed by an `Act:` section.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `deref(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `deref()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You issue run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `Act: describe('http://foo/bar')` or `Act: query('PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }')`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

If nearing about ten cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice than to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `Act: search()`.
* Next, dereference key resources via `Act: deref()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `Act: deref()` to gather information required to construct the query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `Act: deref()`, especially domain and range of properties.
Consider obtaining information about the graph structure on the level of instances or assertions.
* Once you have collected the information requried to write the query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `deref()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

Types of companies

***

Think: The user is asking about different types of companies, which suggests they are looking for a categorization or classification of companies. This could be based on various factors such as size, industry, ownership structure, or legal status. To formulate a query that captures this information, we first need to identify key resources or concepts related to company types.

Act: search('company types') | search('business types') | search('enterprise categories')

Think: The search results for `company types`, `business types`, and `enterprise categories` have returned a mix of specific company instances, geographic locations, and more general concepts related to enterprises. The most relevant result for our purpose seems to be `https://paul.ti.rw.fau.de/~ju32haqi/supply-networks/abstraction-examples/esn-ontology#Enterprise`, which is an ontology concept representing an Enterprise. This could be a useful starting point for exploring different types of companies.

Think: The dereferencing of the Enterprise concept and the search results for company and business classification have provided some insights into the structure of enterprises and how they might be classified. However, the search results are not directly leading to a clear classification system for companies. We need to explore further to find a suitable classification system.

Think: The search results for company type classification and business type taxonomy have provided some leads on potential classification systems, but they are not conclusive. The dereferencing of the Organization concept from the W3C namespace has confirmed that it is a general class for organizations, but it does not provide a specific classification system. We need to continue exploring to find a suitable classification system for companies.

Think: The search results for company categorization and business categorization have provided some general concepts related to organizations, but they do not lead to a specific classification system. The dereferencing of the OrganizationType concept has shown that it is a class for organization types, but it does not provide a clear classification system. We have explored various leads, but a conclusive classification system for companies has not been found. Given the constraints of the task and the information available in the knowledge graph, we cannot formulate a precise query to answer the user's question about types of companies.

Act: fail('Unable to find a conclusive classification system for companies.')
