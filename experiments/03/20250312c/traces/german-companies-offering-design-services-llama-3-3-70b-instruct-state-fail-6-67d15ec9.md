Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `Think:` section followed by an `Act:` section.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `deref(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `deref()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You issue run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `Act: describe('http://foo/bar')` or `Act: query('PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }')`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

If nearing about ten cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice than to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `Act: search()`.
* Next, dereference key resources via `Act: deref()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `Act: deref()` to gather information required to construct the query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `Act: deref()`, especially domain and range of properties.
Consider obtaining information about the graph structure on the level of instances or assertions.
* Once you have collected the information requried to write the query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `deref()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

German companies offering design services

***

Think: The user is looking for German companies that offer design services. To formulate a query, we need to identify the key resources involved, such as German companies and design services. We can start by searching for relevant keywords to find URIs that identify these resources.

Act: search('German companies') | search('design services')

The keyword search for `German companies` returned the following ranked list with hits.

Think: We have found some relevant resources, including the concept of "Design" (https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q288) and "Service" (https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q293), as well as some companies that provide design services, such as "DXCorr Design" (https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/company/weQ790.ttl#this) and "Cadence Design Systems" (https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/company/weQ178.ttl#this). We also found a property "provides service" (https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#providesService). To further expand our knowledge, we can dereference the resource "Germany" (https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/region/wdQ183.ttl#this) to find more information about German companies.

Think: We have gathered more information about the resources involved. We know that "Design" is a type of "Service" and that there is a property "provides service" that relates an organization to a service. We also know that Germany is a feature with a specific class and code. To find German companies that offer design services, we can use the "provides service" property to find organizations that provide the "Design" service and are located in Germany.

Act: query('PREFIX : <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/> PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?x a <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#Organization> . ?x tbox:providesService :Q288 . ?x <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#locatedIn> <https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/region/wdQ183.ttl#this> }')

***

No results for `query('PREFIX : <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/> PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?x a <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#Organization> . ?x tbox:providesService :Q288 . ?x <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#locatedIn> <https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/region/wdQ183.ttl#this> }')`.

***

Think: The query did not return any results. This could be due to the fact that the "locatedIn" property is not explicitly stated in the graph for the organizations that provide the "Design" service. We need to reformulate the query to find organizations that provide the "Design" service, without restricting them to a specific location.

Act: query('PREFIX : <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/> PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?x a <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#Organization> . ?x tbox:providesService :Q288 }')

***

Think: The query still did not return any results. This could be due to the fact that the graph does not contain explicit statements about organizations providing the "Design" service. We need to consider other properties or relationships that could be used to infer this information.

Act: query('PREFIX : <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/> PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?x a <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#Organization> . ?x ?p :Q288 }')

***

Think: The query still did not return any results. At this point, we have tried various approaches to find German companies that offer design services, but the graph does not seem to contain the necessary information to answer this question. We have to give up.

Act: fail('Unable to find German companies that offer design services due to lack of information in the graph.')
