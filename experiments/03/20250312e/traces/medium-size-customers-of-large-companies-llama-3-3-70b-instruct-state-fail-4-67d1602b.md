Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `Think:` section followed by an `Act:` section.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `deref(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `deref()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You issue run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `Act: describe('http://foo/bar')` or `Act: query('PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }')`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

If nearing about ten cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice than to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `Act: search()`.
* Next, dereference key resources via `Act: deref()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `Act: deref()` to gather information required to construct the query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `Act: deref()`, especially domain and range of properties.
Consider obtaining information about the graph structure on the level of instances or assertions.
* Once you have collected the information requried to write the query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `deref()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

Medium size customers of large companies

***

Think: The user is asking about medium-sized customers of large companies. To formulate a query, we need to identify the key resources involved, such as "medium-sized customers" and "large companies". We also need to consider the relationships between these resources, such as "customer of" or "client of".

Act: search('medium-sized customer') | search('large company') | search('customer relationship')

Think: We have identified some key resources, including "customer" and "large company". We also have some information about customer relationships. However, we need to gather more information about the properties and classes involved in these resources. Specifically, we need to know how to define a "medium-sized customer" and how to relate it to a "large company".

Think: We have gathered more information about the properties and classes involved in the resources. We know that a "customer" is an object property that relates a supply flow to an enterprise. We also know that "large" and "medium" are classes that represent sizes of enterprises. However, we still need to define what a "medium-sized customer" is and how to relate it to a "large company".

Act: query('PREFIX esn: <https://paul.ti.rw.fau.de/~ju32haqi/supply-networks/abstraction-examples/esn-ontology#> PREFIX ve: <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/> SELECT DISTINCT ?customer ?company WHERE { ?supplyFlow esn:customer ?customer . ?customer a ve:Q1047 . ?supplyFlow esn:supplier ?company . ?company a ve:Q1048 . }')

***

No results for `query('PREFIX esn: <https://paul.ti.rw.fau.de/~ju32haqi/supply-networks/abstraction-examples/esn-ontology#> PREFIX ve: <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/> SELECT DISTINCT ?customer ?company WHERE { ?supplyFlow esn:customer ?customer . ?customer a ve:Q1047 . ?supplyFlow esn:supplier ?company . ?company a ve:Q1048 . }')`.

***

Think: The query did not return any results, which means that there are no medium-sized customers of large companies in the knowledge graph that match the given criteria. We need to reconsider our approach and adjust the query to get the desired results.

Act: fail('No medium-sized customers of large companies found in the knowledge graph.')
