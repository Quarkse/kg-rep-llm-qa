Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `Think:` section followed by an `Act:` section.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `deref(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `deref()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You issue run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `Act: describe('http://foo/bar')` or `Act: query('PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }')`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

If nearing about ten cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice than to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `Act: search()`.
* Next, dereference key resources via `Act: deref()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `Act: deref()` to gather information required to construct the query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `Act: deref()`, especially domain and range of properties.
Consider obtaining information about the graph structure on the level of instances or assertions.
* Once you have collected the information requried to write the query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `deref()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

People with publications

***

Think: The user is asking about people with publications, which suggests we need to find information about individuals who have authored or co-authored publications. To start, we should identify key resources related to people and publications.

Act: search('person') | search('publication')

Think: We have identified key resources related to people (http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person) and publications (https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#Publication). Next, we should gather more information about these resources by dereferencing them.

Think: We have gathered information about the classes representing people and publications. However, we still need to find a way to connect these two concepts, likely through a property that relates a person to their publications. We should explore the properties related to these classes.

Act: deref('http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/made') | deref('http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/maker') | deref('https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#author') | deref('https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#creator')

Think: Unfortunately, the previous actions did not yield the desired results. We need to reconsider our approach to find the connection between people and their publications. Let's try to find properties related to publications that might link to authors or creators.

Act: query('PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> PREFIX dblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#> SELECT DISTINCT ?p WHERE { ?s ?p ?o . FILTER (?s = dblp:Publication || ?s = foaf:Person) }')

Think: The query results did not provide the expected properties linking people to their publications. We need to adjust our strategy, focusing on finding the right properties or paths that connect authors to publications.

Think: We have not yet found the connection between people and publications. Given the time constraint and the lack of progress, it's necessary to reassess our approach and consider if there's a more direct or alternative method to achieve the goal.

Act: fail('Unable to find a direct connection between people and publications using the current approach. Consider revising the query or exploring additional resources.')
