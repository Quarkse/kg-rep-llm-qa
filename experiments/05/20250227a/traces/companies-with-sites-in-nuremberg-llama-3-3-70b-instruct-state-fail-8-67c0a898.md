Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `Think:` section followed by an `Act:` section.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `deref(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `deref()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You issue run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `Act: describe('http://foo/bar')` or `Act: query('PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }')`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

If nearing about ten cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice than to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `Act: search()`.
* Next, dereference key resources via `Act: deref()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `Act: deref()` to gather information required to construct the query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `Act: deref()`, especially domain and range of properties.
Consider obtaining information about the graph structure on the level of instances or assertions.
* Once you have collected the information requried to write the query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `deref()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

Companies with sites in Nuremberg

***

Think: The user is looking for companies that have sites in Nuremberg. To formulate a query, we need to identify the key resources involved, which are companies and Nuremberg. We can start by searching for URIs that match these keywords.

Act: search('Nuremberg') | search('company')

***

Think: We have found some potential URIs for Nuremberg and companies. However, we need to ensure that these URIs are relevant to the query. We can do this by dereferencing the URIs and examining the triples associated with them.

Act: deref('https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/region/wdQ2090.ttl#this') | deref('https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/company/weQ1104.ttl#this')

Think: We have found some relevant information about Nuremberg and companies. The URI `https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/region/wdQ2090.ttl#this` represents Nuremberg, and it has a property `tbox:childFeature` that links to several companies, including `https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/company/weQ1086.ttl#headquarter` and `https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/company/weQ170.ttl#headquarter`. We can use this information to construct a query that finds companies with sites in Nuremberg.

***

Think: The query did not return any results. This is because the property `ns1:hasRegisteredSite` is not used in the graph. Instead, the property `tbox:organizationType` is used to link companies to their registered sites. We need to modify the query to use the correct property.

Think: We have tried several queries, but none of them returned the desired results. We need to think about the problem from a different perspective. Instead of trying to find companies that have sites in Nuremberg, we can try to find sites that are located in Nuremberg and then find the companies that own those sites.

Think: The query did not return any results. This is because the property `tbox:ownedBy` is not used in the graph. We need to think about the problem from a different perspective.
