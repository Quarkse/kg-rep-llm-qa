Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `Think:` section followed by an `Act:` section.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `deref(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `deref()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You issue run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `Act: describe('http://foo/bar')` or `Act: query('PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }')`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

If nearing about ten cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice than to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `Act: search()`.
* Next, dereference key resources via `Act: deref()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `Act: deref()` to gather information required to construct the query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `Act: deref()`, especially domain and range of properties.
Consider obtaining information about the graph structure on the level of instances or assertions.
* Once you have collected the information requried to write the query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `deref()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

Operationg income of very large companies

***

Think: The user is asking about the operating income of very large companies. To formulate a query, we need to identify the key resources involved, such as the concept of "operating income" and "very large companies". We also need to consider the relevant properties and classes that might be used to describe these resources in the knowledge graph.

Act: search('operating income') | search('very large companies') | search('company size')

The keyword search for `operating income` returned the following ranked list with hits.

Think: We have identified some key resources related to "operating income", "very large companies", and "company size". The next step is to dereference these resources to gather more information about their properties and relationships.

Act: deref("https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#operatingIncome") | deref("https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q1049") | deref("https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q287")

Think: We have gathered more information about the properties and relationships of the key resources. The next step is to use this information to construct a query that retrieves the operating income of very large companies.

Act: query('PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> SELECT ?observation ?operatingIncome WHERE { ?observation a qb:Observation . ?observation tbox:operatingIncome ?operatingIncome . ?observation tbox:enterpriseSize <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q1049> . }')

***

No results for `query('PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> SELECT ?observation ?operatingIncome WHERE { ?observation a qb:Observation . ?observation tbox:operatingIncome ?operatingIncome . ?observation tbox:enterpriseSize <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q1049> . }')`.

***

Think: The query did not return any results. This could be due to the fact that the property `tbox:enterpriseSize` is not being used in the graph to link observations to enterprise sizes. We need to reconsider our approach and find an alternative way to identify very large companies.

Act: query('PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> SELECT ?company ?operatingIncome WHERE { ?company a tbox:Company . ?observation a qb:Observation . ?observation tbox:company ?company . ?observation tbox:operatingIncome ?operatingIncome . FILTER (EXISTS { ?company tbox:enterpriseSize <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q1049> }) }')

***

FILTER (EXISTS { ?company tbox:enterpriseSize <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q1049> }) }')`.

***

Think: The query still did not return any results. At this point, we have to give up as we are running out of options.
