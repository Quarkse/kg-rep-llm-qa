Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `Think:` section followed by an `Act:` section.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `deref(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `deref()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You issue run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `Act: describe('http://foo/bar')` or `Act: query('PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }')`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

If nearing about ten cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice than to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `Act: search()`.
* Next, dereference key resources via `Act: deref()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `Act: deref()` to gather information required to construct the query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `Act: deref()`, especially domain and range of properties.
Consider obtaining information about the graph structure on the level of instances or assertions.
* Once you have collected the information requried to write the query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `deref()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

Services offered by German companies

***

Think: The user is asking about services offered by German companies. To formulate a query, we need to identify key resources such as German companies and the services they offer. We can start by searching for keywords related to German companies and services.

Act: search('German companies') | search('services offered by companies')

***

The keyword search for `German companies` returned the following ranked list with hits.

Think: We have identified some key resources such as German companies and services offered by companies. We can now dereference these resources to gather more information.

Act: deref('https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q287') | deref('https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#providesService') | deref('https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/region/wdQ183.ttl#this')

Think: We have gathered more information about German companies and services offered by companies. We can now use this information to construct a query.

Act: query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX ns1: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#> SELECT DISTINCT ?service WHERE { ?company a tbox:OrganizationType . ?company tbox:providesService ?service . ?company ns1:location <https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/region/wdQ183.ttl#this> . }')

***

No results for `query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX ns1: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#> SELECT DISTINCT ?service WHERE { ?company a tbox:OrganizationType . ?company tbox:providesService ?service . ?company ns1:location <https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/region/wdQ183.ttl#this> . }')`.

***

Think: The query did not return any results. This could be due to the fact that the location of the company is not explicitly stated as Germany. We need to modify the query to account for this.

Act: query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX ns1: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#> SELECT DISTINCT ?service WHERE { ?company a tbox:OrganizationType . ?company tbox:providesService ?service .

FILTER (EXISTS { ?company ns1:location ?location . ?location ns1:featureCode ns1:A.PCLI . ?location rdfs:label "Germany"@en . }) . }')`.

***

Think: The query still did not return any results. This could be due to the fact that the data is not properly connected or the query is not correctly formulated. We need to re-evaluate the query and the data to find a solution.

Act: fail('Unable to find services offered by German companies. The query did not return any results, and the data may not be properly connected or the query may not be correctly formulated.')
