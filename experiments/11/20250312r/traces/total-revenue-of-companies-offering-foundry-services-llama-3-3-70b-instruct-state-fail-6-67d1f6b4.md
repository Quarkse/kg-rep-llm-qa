Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `Think:` section followed by an `Act:` section.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `deref(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `deref()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You issue run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `Act: describe('http://foo/bar')` or `Act: query('PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }')`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

If nearing about ten cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice than to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `Act: search()`.
* Next, dereference key resources via `Act: deref()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `Act: deref()` to gather information required to construct the query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `Act: deref()`, especially domain and range of properties.
Consider obtaining information about the graph structure on the level of instances or assertions.
* Once you have collected the information requried to write the query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `deref()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

Total revenue of companies offering foundry services

***

Think: The user is asking for the total revenue of companies that offer foundry services. To answer this question, we need to identify the key resources involved, which are companies that offer foundry services and their respective revenues. We can start by searching for companies that offer foundry services and then try to find information about their revenues.

Act: search('foundry services companies') | search('revenue of foundry services companies')

Think: We have identified some key resources, including companies that offer foundry services (GlobalFoundries, Analog Devices) and the concept of total revenue. We also have information about the foundry service and the relationship between companies and the services they provide. Next, we can try to gather more information about the total revenue of these companies by dereferencing the URIs of the companies and the total revenue concept.

Act: deref('https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/company/weQ37.ttl#this') | deref('https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#totalRevenue')

Think: We have gathered more information about GlobalFoundries and the concept of total revenue. GlobalFoundries is an enterprise that provides various services, including foundry services. The total revenue concept is a measure property that represents the observed total revenue of an enterprise. Next, we can try to find the total revenue of GlobalFoundries by querying the knowledge graph.

Act: query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> SELECT ?revenue WHERE { <https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/company/weQ37.ttl#this> qb:observation ?obs . ?obs tbox:totalRevenue ?revenue . }')

***

No results for `query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> SELECT ?revenue WHERE { <https://solid.iis.fraunhofer.de/oe-40200/2024/10/velektronik-graph-clean/company/weQ37.ttl#this> qb:observation ?obs . ?obs tbox:totalRevenue ?revenue . }')`.

***

Think: The query did not return any results, which means that the knowledge graph does not contain information about the total revenue of GlobalFoundries. We can try to expand the query to include other companies that provide foundry services.

Act: query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> PREFIX ns1: <https://www.w3.org/ns/org#> SELECT ?company ?revenue WHERE { ?company a ns1:Organization . ?company tbox:providesService <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q291> . ?company qb:observation ?obs . ?obs tbox:totalRevenue ?revenue . }')

***

No results for `query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> PREFIX ns1: <https://www.w3.org/ns/org#> SELECT ?company ?revenue WHERE { ?company a ns1:Organization . ?company tbox:providesService <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q291> . ?company qb:observation ?obs . ?obs tbox:totalRevenue ?revenue . }')`.

***

Think: The query still did not return any results. It seems that the knowledge graph does not contain information about the total revenue of companies that provide foundry services. We can try to find information about the revenue of these companies in general, without specifying the type of revenue.

Act: query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> PREFIX ns1: <https://www.w3.org/ns/org#> SELECT ?company ?revenue WHERE { ?company a ns1:Organization . ?company tbox:providesService <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q291> . ?company tbox:totalRevenue ?revenue . }')

***

***

Think: The query still did not return any results. It seems that the knowledge graph does not contain information about the revenue of companies that provide foundry services. We have tried different approaches, but unfortunately, we were unable to find the required information.

Act: fail('Unable to find information about the total revenue of companies offering foundry services.')
