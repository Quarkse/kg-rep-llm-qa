Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `Think:` section followed by an `Act:` section.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `deref(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `deref()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You issue run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `Act: describe('http://foo/bar')` or `Act: query('PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }')`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

If nearing about ten cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice than to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `Act: search()`.
* Next, dereference key resources via `Act: deref()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `Act: deref()` to gather information required to construct the query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `Act: deref()`, especially domain and range of properties.
Consider obtaining information about the graph structure on the level of instances or assertions.
* Once you have collected the information requried to write the query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `deref()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

Total equity of foundry companies

***

Think: The user is asking for the total equity of foundry companies. To formulate a query for this, we need to identify the key resources involved, which are "foundry companies" and "total equity". We can start by searching for URIs that match these keywords.

Act: search('foundry companies') | search('total equity')

***

The keyword search for `foundry companies` returned the following ranked list with hits.

Think: We have identified the key resources involved in the user's question, which are "foundry companies" and "total equity". The search results provide us with URIs for these resources, including https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q287 for "Foundry" and https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#totalEquity for "total equity". We can now use these URIs to dereference the resources and gather more information.

Act: deref('https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q287') | deref('https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#totalEquity')

Think: We have gathered more information about the resources involved in the user's question. The dereferenced resources provide us with additional details, such as the label "Foundry" for the organization type and the definition of "total equity" as a measure property with a decimal range. We can now use this information to construct a query that retrieves the total equity of foundry companies.

Act: query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> SELECT ?totalEquity WHERE { ?company a tbox:Foundry . ?observation a qb:Observation . ?observation qb:observation ?company . ?observation tbox:totalEquity ?totalEquity . }')

***

No results for `query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> SELECT ?totalEquity WHERE { ?company a tbox:Foundry . ?observation a qb:Observation . ?observation qb:observation ?company . ?observation tbox:totalEquity ?totalEquity . }')`.

***

Think: The query did not return any results, which means that the pattern used to match the total equity of foundry companies did not match any data in the knowledge graph. We need to revise the query to better match the data.

Act: query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> SELECT ?totalEquity WHERE { ?company a tbox:OrganizationType . ?company tbox:organizationType tbox:Foundry . ?observation a qb:Observation . ?observation qb:observation ?company . ?observation tbox:totalEquity ?totalEquity . }')

***

No results for `query('PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> PREFIX qb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#> SELECT ?totalEquity WHERE { ?company a tbox:OrganizationType . ?company tbox:organizationType tbox:Foundry . ?observation a qb:Observation . ?observation qb:observation ?company . ?observation tbox:totalEquity ?totalEquity . }')`.

***

Think: The query still did not return any results. At this point, we have tried various query patterns and still haven't found a match. It's possible that the data is not available in the knowledge graph or that the query is not correctly formulated.

Act: fail('Unable to find total equity of foundry companies. Tried various query patterns but did not find a match.')
