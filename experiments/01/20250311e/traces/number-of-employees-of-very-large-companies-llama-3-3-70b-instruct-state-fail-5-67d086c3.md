Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `Think:` section followed by an `Act:` section.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `deref(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `deref()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You issue run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `Act: describe('http://foo/bar')` or `Act: query('PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }')`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

If nearing about ten cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice than to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `Act: search()`.
* Next, dereference key resources via `Act: deref()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `Act: deref()` to gather information required to construct the query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `Act: deref()`, especially domain and range of properties.
Consider obtaining information about the graph structure on the level of instances or assertions.
* Once you have collected the information requried to write the query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `deref()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

Number of employees of very large companies

***

Think: The user is asking for the number of employees of very large companies. To answer this question, we need to identify the key resources involved, which are "very large companies" and "number of employees". We also need to consider what constitutes a "very large company", which could be based on the number of employees, revenue, or other factors.

Act: search('very large companies') | search('number of employees')

The keyword search for `very large companies` returned the following ranked list with hits.

Think: We have identified some key resources related to "very large companies" and "number of employees". The search results include a concept for "very large" companies and a property for "employees". We can use these resources to construct a query to answer the user's question.

Act: deref('https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/Q1049') | deref('https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#employees')

Think: We have gathered more information about the key resources involved. The concept of "very large" companies is defined as a subclass of another concept, and the property for "employees" is a datatype property with a range of decimal values. We can use this information to construct a query to answer the user's question.

Act: query('PREFIX : <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/> PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> SELECT ?x ?y WHERE { ?x a :Q1049 . ?x tbox:employees ?y . }')

***

No results for `query('PREFIX : <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/> PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> SELECT ?x ?y WHERE { ?x a :Q1049 . ?x tbox:employees ?y . }')`.

***

Think: The query did not return any results. This could be because the concept of "very large" companies is not directly related to the property for "employees", or because there are no instances of "very large" companies in the knowledge graph that have a value for the "employees" property. We need to refine the query to get the desired results.

Act: query('PREFIX : <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/> PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> SELECT ?x ?y WHERE { ?x a :Q1048 . ?x tbox:employees ?y . FILTER (?y > 1000) }')

***

No results for `query('PREFIX : <https://welektronik.iis.fraunhofer.de/entity/> PREFIX tbox: <https://github.com/wintechis/natural-language-query-answering/tree/main/knowledge-graph/velektronik-graph-clean/tbox.ttl#> SELECT ?x ?y WHERE { ?x a :Q1048 . ?x tbox:employees ?y . FILTER (?y > 1000) }')`.

***

Think: The query still did not return any results. At this point, we have tried various approaches to answer the user's question, but we have not been able to find any relevant information in the knowledge graph. We should inform the user that we were unable to find an answer to their question.

Act: fail('Sorry, I was unable to find any information about the number of employees of very large companies.')
