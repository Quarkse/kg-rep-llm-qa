Task

You are Graf von Data, an assistant designed to formulate a query based on input from User.

Process

You interact with a knowledge graph in a strict think-act-observe cycle.

1. Think: Analyse the question from User and the descriptions in the representations gathered so far.
2. Act: Choose available actions (listed below) that will best progress towards formulating the query.
3. Observe: HALT. System will provide the result of your chosen actions in the next cycle.

In your response, start with a `Think:` section followed by an `Act:` section.

Actions

You can issue one or multiple of the following actions.

* `search(keywords: string)`: Get URIs to resources matching the given `keywords`. Look for URIs that identify entities, i.e., make two calls: `search('foo')` and `search('bar')` instead of `search('foo bar')`.
* `deref(resource URI: string)`: Get all triples with `resource URI` in subject position. Expand (https://www.w3.org/TR/curie)[Compact URIs] to absolute URIs for use with `deref()`.
* `query(sparql: string)`: Evaluate `sparql` and get solutions. Consider using path expressions, i.e., `*` or `+` for paths of transitive properties and `|` for alternative paths.

You issue run actions concurrently using `|`, e.g., `search('foo') | search('bar')`.
Format action calls as follows: `Act: describe('http://foo/bar')` or `Act: query('PREFIX : <#> SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ... }')`.
Use quotes for arguments.

Chat

Sometimes User does not seek factual information.

* `chat(text: string)`: Issue a `chat()` action if User does not seek factual information from the knowledge graph.

Conditions

Once you have come up with the final query, check the query via `query()` and then end.

* `success(text: string)`: Confirm the query as final and optionally give User a concise message explaining the relevant steps you took. Do not mention the query or the query solutions.

If nearing about ten cycles:

* `fail(text: string)`: You have no other choice than to give up. Optionally report to User the relevant steps you tried.

Stages

* Identify key resources in the User question and find URIs via `Act: search()`.
* Next, dereference key resources via `Act: deref()`.
Iteratively expand your knowledge about the graph via `Act: deref()` to gather information required to construct the query.
Consider obtaining information about classes and properties via `Act: deref()`, especially domain and range of properties.
Consider obtaining information about the graph structure on the level of instances or assertions.
* Once you have collected the information requried to write the query, make sure to include in the query definite descriptions of the key resources.
Then, expand the query iteratively with more triple patterns.

Critical Instructions

* Ensure that all URIs used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.
* Only use URIs that have been previously mentioned or discovered via `search()` or `deref()`.
* Never repeat successfully executed actions, the results will be the same.

System has access to ['..\\knowledge-graph\\velektronik-graph-clean\\abox-en.ttl.gz', '..\\knowledge-graph\\velektronik-graph-clean\\tbox.ttl'] with 32276 triples. System version v0.2.8-91-g5e507554 is using llama-3.3-70b-instruct at chat-ai.academiccloud.de.

People with publications

***

Think: The user is asking for people with publications. This implies that we need to find individuals who have authored or co-authored publications. To achieve this, we first need to identify the key resources involved, such as the concept of "people" and "publications".

Act: search('person') | search('publication')

Think: We have identified key resources for "person" and "publication". The next step is to dereference these resources to gather more information about them, which will help us construct a query to find people with publications.

Act: deref('http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person') | deref('https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#Publication') | deref('https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#Creator')

***

Think: We have gathered information about the key resources. It seems that `https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#Creator` is a subclass of `foaf:Person` and is related to publications. This suggests that we can use the `https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#Creator` property to find people who have created publications.

Act: query('PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> PREFIX dblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#> SELECT DISTINCT ?person WHERE { ?person a foaf:Person . ?person dblp:Creator ?publication . }')

***

No results for `query('PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> PREFIX dblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#> SELECT DISTINCT ?person WHERE { ?person a foaf:Person . ?person dblp:Creator ?publication . }')`.

***

Think: The query did not return any results. This could be due to the fact that the `dblp:Creator` property is not directly related to `foaf:Person`. We need to re-examine the relationships between the resources and adjust the query accordingly.

Act: query('PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> PREFIX dblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#> SELECT DISTINCT ?person WHERE { ?person a foaf:Person . ?publication dblp:creator ?person . }')

***

Think: The query still did not return any results. It seems that we need to adjust the query to correctly represent the relationship between people and publications. We should also ensure that the properties and classes used in the query exist in the knowledge graph.

Act: query('PREFIX dblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#> SELECT DISTINCT ?person WHERE { ?person a dblp:Creator . }')

***

The query 'PREFIX dblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#> SELECT DISTINCT ?person WHERE { ?person a dblp:Creator . }' returned the following solution.

***

Think: The query returned some results, which are instances of `dblp:Creator`. However, we want to find people who have publications. Since `dblp:Creator` is a subclass of `foaf:Person`, we can use this information to construct a query that finds people who have created publications.

Act: query('PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> PREFIX dblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#> SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?publication WHERE { ?person a foaf:Person . ?person dblp:creator ?publication . }')

***

Think: The query did not return any results. It seems that we have reached a point where we need to re-evaluate our approach. We have tried various queries, but none of them have returned the desired results. At this point, we have no other choice but to give up.

Act: fail('Unable to find people with publications. Tried various queries, but none returned the desired results.')
